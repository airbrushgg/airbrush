# Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to Airbrush, whether on GitHub or in other community spaces:

- Be respectful, civil, and open-minded.
- Before opening a new pull request, try searching through the issue tracker for known issues or fixes.
- If you want to make code changes based on your personal opinion(s), make sure you open an issue first describing the changes you want to make, and open a pull request only when your suggestions get approved by maintainers.

## How to Contribute

### Prerequisites

In order to not waste your time implementing a change that has already been declined, or is generally not needed, start by opening an issue describing the problem you would like to solve.

### Fork the repository

Fork the repository, and clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbrushgg/airbrush.git
```

### Create a branch

Create a branch with a descriptive name. We recommend using the following naming convention:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-name>/<short-description>
```

For example:

```bash
git checkout -b astrid/add-catgirls
```

### Setup your environment locally

Airbrush ships with a pre-configured development environment, which you can use to set up your project locally. Learn more [here](/dev-env/README.md).

### Make your changes

After you've set up your environment, you can start making and testing your changes live. Once you're done, be sure to use descriptive commit messages and follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

### Make your pull request

When you're ready to submit your changes, push your branch to your fork and open a pull request. Fill out the title and body appropriately, and again, make sure to follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). for your title.

### Wait for a response

After submitting your pull request, be sure to wait for feedback from us! We may suggest some changes or improvements, or we may ask for more information.
